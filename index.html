        Spending time with you is probably my <strong>favourite thing</strong> to do.
        No matter what we're doing, somehow I always end up looking forward to it a little more every time.
        I don't think I could have asked for a better person to know in Mumbai —
        gotta rate you <strong>4.9/5</strong> for the person you are (be proud).
        </p>

        <p>
        I love how you're <em>sorted but also chaotic</em>, 
        <em>cool but also cute</em>, 
        <em>smart but also dumb</em>, 
        <em>calm but also panicky</em>, 
        so so pretty but also even more ridiculously prettier when you're smiling 
        (yes I say it a lot but I love your smile sm istg).
        </p>

        <p>
        I genuinely love the vibe we share — thodi si mc hone ke baad bhi achi insaan toh hai tu 
        <em>(things men have to say 😞)</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
        The cab rides back to your place with you, staying back until we finish work,
        the gossips we share, the endless plans we make, exploring different cafes,
        bars, pubs and breweries with you — I've loved <strong>every hour, every minute
        and every second</strong> I've spent with you.
        </p>

        <p>
        And I can only hope that I get to explore the hundreds of cafes, restobars
        and pubs remaining in Mumbai and beyond with you :)
        </p>

        <p>
        I just love how even the simplest of plans ends up being so much fun with you around.
        At the same time, it's funny how I feel like I've known you for ages,
        but also like there's still so much more to discover about you.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
        So before you freak out (if you aren't already),
        this isn't anything dramatic — just my realisation that since it's always
        been you who I leave it upon to decide what to do when we hang out,
        for once I should be decisive and take you out somewhere :)
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>So, Tashvinder ji… would you be free for a few hours this weekend?</strong>
